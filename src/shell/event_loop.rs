/// This trait defines the interface for a window event handler. It is

///
/// This approach was chosen (2022-07-28) because it is the most flexible and
/// offers good isolation between event handlers and the OS' windowing system
/// whilst supporting a convenient way to associate state with each window. It
/// also offers the ability to be polymorphic over the implementation of the
/// event handler, greatly simplifying the event loop.
///
/// However, there are a couple tradeoffs to this approach:
///
///  - There is a likely cache miss every frame, since the event handler has
///    likely been displaced by the time a new frame is needed by
///    application-specific and rendering code. It should only be one miss,
///    however, since input event handlers are likely to be relatively small
///    relative to `on_redraw()`.
///  - Allocating the trait object involves a heap allocation with its
///    associated costs in time and space (fragmentation).
///  - The amount of code required for a codebase with only one implementor of
///    WindowEventHandler is likely similar to just using that implementor
///    directly (at the cost of increased coupling).
